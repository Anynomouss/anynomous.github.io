## Grin for muggles and aspiring wizards
The objective of this site is to provide documentation to help muggles and aspiring wizards to better understand Grin. On purpose I specify "Grin" and not "mimblewimble" since I want to be as practically orietented and very explicit in this documentation. I hope it will help you on your journey down the Grin rabbit hole, writing things down certainly helped me to acchieve greater clarity.
